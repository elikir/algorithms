#A collection of algorithms that I will try to make over time more
 efficient when I learn new methods of doing so.

 Each algorithm will run 100 times 100
 times and find the average time of the algorithm 100 times using the method in performance.py

 ====

 It should be noted that there are much better ways to check efficiency, but BigO theory is mainly what I'm going for.
 Any machine can make any algorithm run faster, and any code can be optomized, but n^2 is much slower than n which
 is much slower than lg(n), which is what I'm trying to show.
